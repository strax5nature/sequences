Dear Hashim,

My name is Iurii Izbachkov. I am from Moscow (Russia).
I experimented with mathematical sequences a'la Fibonacci (Lucas).
Then I calculated the limit values and searched on Google for where these values occur.

I found your article:
Heat Transport during Colloidal Mixture of Water with Al2O3-SiO2 Nanoparticles within Porous Medium: Semi-Analytical Solutions

In table 2, you and your colleagues refine Turkyilmazoglu's data.
On the first line you enter the values
1.8832035 1.883203505 0.53101006 0.531010056

I think more accurate data would be:
1.883203505913526 0.5310100564595692

This is the numeric value of the limit and inverse limit of the ratio of a member of the sequence to the previous one.
The sequence looks like this:

Sn = Sn-1 + Sn-2 + Sn-3 + Sn-4 - Sn-5

I have attached a script in Python.

Sincerely,
Iurii Izbachkov

P.S. It's funny, but my scientific interests are mainly in cultural studies, archeology, ballet and criminal law.
